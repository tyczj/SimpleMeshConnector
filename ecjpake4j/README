This module is a thin JNI wrapper around the EC-JPAKE interface of mbedtls.

If you ever need to rebuild the version of mbedtls in the distribution folder, 
just 'cd' to the ecjpake4j dir, and run build_mbedtls.sh

(Note that you will probably have to edit that script to specify the location 
of your Android NDK install)
